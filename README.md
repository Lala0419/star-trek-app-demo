## About The App/ How to use:

This is a fun simple app where you can find some star-trek charactersâ€™ information. This was my first time creating the API. I added the API to my [server-side file](https://github.com/Lala0419/star-trek-api-demo) and deployed it to Heroku. You can type the name of the characters and you will have their Species name,
Home-world, Distinguishing Features, Interesting Fact(s) and Notable Examples if that matches the API object I created. Otherwise, if that does not match, you will get human information as error handling.

## How It's Made:

This was my first attempt at creating my own API. I wanted to focus on the backend side and it was a very good practice of using Node.js, express and Heroku.

## Tech Used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node.js



## Lessons Learned:


I was able to learn much more about API by creating one myself. Learned how to use postman to check my progress as well as how to deploy the file to Heroku which took me a while to succeed.
